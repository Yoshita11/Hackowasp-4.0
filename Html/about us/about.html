<p><b><u>ABOUT US:</u></b>
    <b>India on an average produces around 64 million tonnes of waste every day. Out of this, a large proportion of the waste is generated by the youth of the country. Talking about some institutions in particular, some of the well renowned colleges/institutions of India produce around 100kgs of waste everyday clearly signifying the mammoth collection of waste which is now left to be dumped.
    Shoonya provides the respective institutions various ways and equipment to minimize their waste till its quantity almost reaches to zero. On the successful implementation of the goals decided by "Shoonya”, the respective institution would receive a nationally recognized certification stating that the campus has been successful in zero waste management. This initiative would not only help in waste management but it would also help the college in enhancing its value.
